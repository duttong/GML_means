# GML_means

# The main program, gml_annualmeans.py, loads data from the NOAA/GML website (formerly the FTP site) and calculates annual global means. The file gml_config.yaml controls the list of gases and data sources for the yearly mean calculations. 

The loading of GML data is handled by the code in the NOAA_halocarbons_loader repository.

Results are stored in the gml_annual_means directory.
